# Lists and Pointer structures

### Beginning with an example
* Supports for pointers exist within your computers hardware, known as indirect addressing.

```python
s = set()
```

`s` is not necessarily a set, rather a pointer that points to the beginning address of a set


### Arrays
* Arrays store pieces of data sequentially, meaning that all pieces of memory are also stored sequentially.
* If there isn't enough sequential memory to allocate for an array, there will be problems
* Arrays are very fast due to the fact that all memory is sequential, meaning that no jumps around to different bits of memory have to be made:set mouse=a
*
